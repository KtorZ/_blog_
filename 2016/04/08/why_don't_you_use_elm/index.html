There’re loads of frontend technologies running currently, and the trendiest one might be <em>React</em>. I’ve played rather reasonnably with <em>React</em> and <em>Backbone</em>, and I am now diving seriously into <em>Angular</em> (you know, one has to make a living). Incidentally, I am a huge fan of functional reactive programming and <em>Elm</em> has definitely all my love and devotion. <strong>Why aren’t more people learning <em>Elm</em>?</strong></p> <!--more--> <p>So, let me try to make a point. Each time one learns a new framework, one gets used to the intrinsic philosophy that this framework builds. <em>React</em> expects you to understand what components are and how they behave towards their properties, states and listeners. It also requires you to have an idea of what is happening at the rendering level with the virtual dom. <em>Angular</em> on the other hand presents a slew of services you can inject in your controllers, factories, directives and how they play well with the two-way data-binding. I won’t carp about <em>Backbone</em> because you’ve get the idea. Each framework demands some knowledge, a set of prerequisite that may echo from one to another but nonetheless stay disparate. Although they usually rely on strong theoretical concepts, they are often <strong>so deeply entangled in the framework</strong> that it is complicated to <strong>use them out of their initial context</strong>. You’ll get familiar with the <em>React</em> way, or the <em>Angular</em> way yet you’re not likely to re-use their concepts elsewhere on your own (mainly because you’ll be using another framework and be compliant with new patterns). Why don’t you learn <em>Elm</em> instead? Well I know, <em>Elm</em> is a different language (and a functional one, yuck!) and the learning curve is way too important. Meh.</p> <p>Therefore, it seems familiar and comfortable, as the big majority of frontend frameworks is built on top of <em>JavaScript</em>, to stick with <em>JavaScript</em> as much as possible. Hence, it feels like there’s one less barrier to overcome; the underlying language is always the same, isn’t it? Having a quick look at the <em>JavaScript</em> in <em>Angular</em>, and the one in <em>React</em>, it really looks like two fairly different flavors of <em>JavaScript</em>. The former would rather use a Vanilla/ES5 <em>JavaScript</em> whereas the latter embraces ES6/ES7 with an extensive usage of destructuring and methods declaration shortcuts. It really sounds like two different - albeit from a common ancestor - languages. <strong>You end up learning two distinct languages</strong>. So what’s your excuse now?</p> <p>Instead of learning a framework (and its underlying <em>JavaScript</em> flavor), you’re able to deal with a language which will by itself, intrinsically, offer you <strong>all the control and the behaviour you’ll expect from a framework</strong>. Plus, because you are directly facing patterns and concerns which built your code, you’re getting stronger insights. There’s one remark though. I’ve been told the main issue with <em>Elm</em> was about reading the documentation. For non functional programming developers, it appears to be an impenetrable dialect whereas documentations from the trendiest frameworks are more “standard”, more usual. Inasmuch as it seems to be the only obstacle that keeps you away from <em>Elm</em>, let’s spend five more minutes together to break through this.</p> <p>So here we are, talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system">Hindley-Milner</a> type signatures. Besides being present in every functional programming language (like the mighty <em>Haskell</em> for instance), it is a powerful way of communicating insights. Trust me on that, once you can read them fluently, <strong>it becomes the best documentation you’ll ever experience</strong>. Let’s start with an excerpt of <em>Elm</em>’s documentation:</p> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span class="nf">isEmpty</span><span class="kt">:</span> <span class="kt">String</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">Bool</span></code></pre></figure> <p>First, there’s the function’s identifier <code>isEmpty</code> that names the signature. Then, we find two types separated by an arrow. Incidentally, this type system is seemingly relevant because <em>Elm</em> is a strongly statically typed language. Although it sounds rather obvious, it is worth a remark. So, the arrow basically means that given what is on the left side, your function will give you what is on the right side. In this case, this is straightforward, given a <code>String</code>, you’ll get a result of <code>Bool</code> type. What about several arrows?</p> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span class="nf">repeat</span> <span class="kt">:</span> <span class="kt">Int</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">String</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">String</span></code></pre></figure> <p>Well, the previous rule still applies. There’re now two different cases though. We either provide an <code>Int</code> to the <code>repeat</code> function, or we provide an <code>Int</code> and a <code>String</code> (in that order). In the second case, we get a <code>String</code> as a result.</p> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span class="nf">repeat</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="s">&quot;patate&quot;</span> 
<span class="c1">-- &quot;patatepatate</span></code></pre></figure> <p>In the first case however, we obtain a function that will, given a <code>String</code>, return a <code>String</code>. Assuming we provided <code>2</code> as an <code>Int</code>, then we could write the result the following way:</p> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span class="nf">repeat2</span><span class="kt">:</span> <span class="kt">String</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">String</span>
<span class="nf">repeat2</span> <span class="ow">=</span> 
    <span class="n">repeat</span> <span class="mi">2</span>

<span class="nf">repeat2</span> <span class="s">&quot;patate&quot;</span>
<span class="c1">-- &quot;patatepatate&quot;</span></code></pre></figure> <p>Can you feel <strong>the expressiveness</strong> of the type system? Brace yourself, there’s more. Try to get this one by yourself:</p> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span class="nf">length</span><span class="kt">:</span> <span class="kt">List</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">Int</span></code></pre></figure> <p>At first sight, this signature looks quite unusal. There’s a new type <code>List</code> but, with a <em>parametric</em> type-variable <code>a</code>. Should you haven’t guess it, this signifies that your <code>List</code> holds… something, something of type <code>a</code>. It could be an <code>Int</code>, it could be a <code>Bool</code> or it could be a <code>List Int</code> as well. It nonetheless ensures that your list is made only from element of that same type. The eventual meaning of the signature is that given a <code>List</code> of something, it will always return an <code>Int</code>. By the by, this is fair enough as we don’t need to know what are the types of the elements of the list to know how many of them are in the list, right? One more before I let you go code some <em>Elm</em>.</p> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span class="nf">map</span><span class="kt">:</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">List</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">List</span> <span class="n">b</span></code></pre></figure> <p>First of all, parentheses indicate here a coupling between variables; they enhance the readability and give us a tiny hint about the meaning of the whole function. They indicate the first parameter has to be a function, meaning that <code>(a -&gt; b)</code> should be provided as a block. Thus you’ll give a function that takes a type <code>a</code> and returns a type <code>b</code>. Moreover, we now have two different type-variables to identify two (possibly) different types. They don’t have to be different though, but they <em>might</em> be. It could be <code>Int -&gt; String</code>, as well as <code>Bool -&gt; Bool</code>. Yet, every <code>a</code> in the signature has the same type, and every <code>b</code> is consistent as well. Should you already be familiar with the <code>map</code> function in <em>JavaScript</em>, this is the <em>Elmish</em> version. Given a function from type <code>a</code> to type <code>b</code> and a <code>List</code> of <code>a</code>, you get a mapped <code>List</code> of <code>b</code>. For instance in <em>JavaScript</em>:</p> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;patate&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;autruche&quot;</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nx">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">// [6, 8]</span></code></pre></figure> <p>And the equivalent in <em>Elm</em>:</p> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span class="kt">List</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">map</span> <span class="kt">String</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">length</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&quot;patate&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;autruche&quot;</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="c1">-- [6, 8]</span></code></pre></figure> <p>There are some more theory and syntax properties about <em>Hindley-Milner</em> signatures, however this is what is needed to cover almost all <em>Elm</em> signatures you’ll find in packages. Understanding these signatures gives you access to a whole new part of the documentation. In the same time, it even allows you to reason about your code and to build your application quite easily. So, what are you waiting for? There’re few dependencies, it’s blazingly fast, built for frontend developers, and it’s free from any framework shackles. <strong>Elm really focuses on frontend developers needs</strong> in such a way that the gap between your experience and functional programming is much smaller. Lot of frameworks today seemingly borrow <em>Elm</em> core concepts on which they based their architecture (<em>Cycle</em> and <em>React</em>+<em>Redux</em> are good examples of that).</p> <p>Now, <strong><a href="http://elm-lang.org/try">go learn some <em>Elm</em></a></strong>.
