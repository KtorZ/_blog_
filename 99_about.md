### Who I am

Hi! My name is *KtorZ* a.k.a *Matthias Benkort* and I am a passionnate developer and computer
scientist. Doing better every other day is basically what I am striving to. Computer science is
such a wide domain; there is always something new to see, a fresh piece of knowledge to grab
or something that will in a way busy your brain for a while. That's awesome.

I really enjoy challenges and algorithmic problems. Above all, if it implies artificial
intelligence, machine learning or functional programming, this is the icing on the cake. What
am I doing right now? I am facing motivating challenges, sharpening my programming skills and
insights; All of that surrounded by other passionate developers and great folks. 

### What I believe in

- One of the most important thing in a personal development is our ability to learn.
- Everyone is equal in front of knowledge as long as one put the effort into it.
- The acquisition of wealth shouldn't be the driving force of our lives anymore.
- Sharing and communicating ought to be our top priority.
- One doesn't need a lot to succeed; common sense and hard work are usually enough.
- The more I learn, the more I see how much I still have to learn.
- We need art like music, cinema or painting because this is what makes us feel human. I do need
  music, a lot.
- I do things because I am happy doing so, not because an occult force is pushing me to.
- I strive to keep my expectations about my work higher than the average people such that if I
  am fine with some piece of work, it is likely to be okay for anyone else.

### The goals I pursue

So far, I am still young and I need to learn, to get more skilled and more confident in
development and software engineering in general. In a long-term, I do love playing with
artificial intelligence and machine learning as well as I bask in the video game universe. I
wish I could see myself involved in a video game development, closely talking with some
researchers to implement artificial intelligence algorithms. 

In a shorter term, I am trying to explore JavaScript and Haskell in depth. Both are highly
capable languages and allow me to get rich insights about programming and softwares. Mastering
these two languages and concepts orbiting around them might be if not helpful, at least
interesting and rewarding.

To fulfill such a dream, I need to get used to machine learning, functional programming and
good patterns. Designing software solutions and being involved in some start-up
projects is both motivating and full of enlightment.
