### Who I am
Hi! My name is *KtorZ* a.k.a *Matthias Benkort* and I am a passionnate developer and computer
scientist. Doing better every other day is basically what I am striving to. Computer science is
such a wide domain; there is always something new to see, a fresh piece of knowledge to grab
or something that will in a way busy your brain for a while. That's awesome.

I really enjoy challenges and algorithmic problems. Above all, if it implies artificial
intelligence, machine learning or functional programming, this is the icing on the cake. What
am I doing right now? I am facing motivating challenges, sharpening my programming skills and
insights; All of that surrounded by other passionate developers and great folks. 

### What I believe in

- One of the most important thing in a personal development is our ability to learn
- There is a lesson in everything  
- Everyone is equal in front of knowledge as long as one put the effort into it
