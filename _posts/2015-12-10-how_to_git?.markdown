Article summary.

<!--more-->

#### ... change the last commit

```
git add ...
git commit --amend -C HEAD
``` 

Incidentally, `-C` option (as well as `-c` that also let you edit the message) can be used to
re-use any any commit's message you wish. By giving it `HEAD`, we just ask for the last one. 

#### ... change the last commit's message

```
git add [whatever]
git commit --amend -m "<whatever>"
```

#### ... rebase and preserve commit dates

```
git rebase --onto <newbase> <branch> <upstream>
git rebase --committer-date-is-author-date <newbase>
```

By default, a `git rebase` does not overwrite the author dates. Thus, after having perform the
rebase, one can still ask git to rewrite all commit dates and make them match their author

#### ... make an empty commit

```
git commit --allow-empty -m "<whatever>"
```

#### ... change message of a set of commits

```
git filter-branch --msg-filter 'echo "<whatever> $(cat)"' <branch>...<REF_LIMIT>
```

Here, `$(cat)` prints the previous commit message such that we can append or prepend elements
to that message. Also, by default (without `<branch>...<REF_LIMIT>`), the transformation will
apply to the entire branch. By specifying a `REF_LIMIT`, which is a commit ref, it is possible
to stop the process on that specified commit (exclusive, the `REF_LIMIT` isn't affected).

#### ... change the commit date of a previous commit

```
git filter-branch --env-filter \
'if [ $GIT_COMMIT = <whatever_commit_hash> ]
 then
 export GIT_AUTHOR_DATE=<whatever_date>
 export GIT_COMMITTER_DATE=<whatever_date>
 fi'
```

Git supports several date format, for instance: `dd.mm.aaaaThh:mm` is one of them and is
seemingly handy.
