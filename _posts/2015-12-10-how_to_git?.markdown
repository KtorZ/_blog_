Article summary.

<!--more-->

#### ... change the last commit

```
git add ...
git commit --amend -C HEAD
``` 

Incidentally, `-C` option (as well as `-c` that also let you edit the message) can be used to
re-use any any commit's message you wish. By giving it `HEAD`, we just ask for the last one. 

#### ... change the last commit's message

```
git add [whatever]
git commit --amend -m "<whatever>"
```

#### ... rebase and preserve commit dates

```
git rebase --onto <newbase> <branch> <upstream>
git rebase --committer-date-is-author-date <newbase>
```

By default, a `git rebase` does not overwrite the author dates. Thus, after having perform the
rebase, one can still ask git to rewrite all commit dates and make them match their author

#### ... make an empty commit

```
git commit --allow-empty -m "<whatever>"
```
