*Confucius* used to say that and when it comes to explain people why am I working so hard
sometimes, I would like to have only these words to say each time; because it's that simple. 

Thinking about work, one would say with confidence that a work deserves a corresponding salary.
I would rather say that a given salary deserves an equivalent work. Thus, if one's not working
for a salary, why the hell should we work ?
