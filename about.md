### Who I am

Functional Programming & Philosophy enthusiast. Programming elegant solutions for puzzling
problems has been my passion since I am ten. Besides, cooking, bouldering, exploring music, and
drinking tea are the current pillars of my personal well-being.

### My values

- I value others’ opinions and help.
- I proudly do because I enjoy doing it.
- I learn, question, adapt and evolve constantly.
- I base my decisions upon rational arguments and researches.
- I keep my own expectations always higher.
- I share and I communicate transparently.
- I eat my cheese with a Baguette.
